# Test-first Data Structures

Data Structures are very important to programming in general and are a great way to better understand object oriented programming.

In this workshop, we are going to be writing the JavaScript implementations of some different data structures including: Queues, Stacks, Linked Lists and Binary Trees (in that order). The required exercises are Queues, Stacks and Linked List. Implementing BSTs is bonus if you can get to it, since we will be doing another exercise to get a lot of exercies with Trees.

You should write your code in the classical JavaScript style. The "prototypal" method of JS Object Oriented JS is up and coming but it's still important we know how to work in Classical JavaScript Object Oriented code.


###Important Tip for Stack & Queue

Since the purpose of this exercise is to implement a Stack and Queue class, you may not use JavaScript's built in push/pop/shift/unshift functions. You can use an Object or Array to store your data and keep a head and tail pointer that moves around when functions like enqueue and dequeue are called.
