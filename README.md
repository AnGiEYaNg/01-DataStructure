# Test-first Data Structures

Data Structures are very important to programming in general and are a great way to better understand object oriented programming.

In this workshop, we are going to be writing the JavaScript implementations of some different data structures including: Queues, Linked Lists, Hash Tables and optionally Binary Trees (in that order). The required exercises are Queues, Linked List and Hash Table. Implementing BSTs is bonus if you can get to it, since we will be doing another exercise to get a lot of exercies with Trees.

###Important Tip for Queue

Since the purpose of this exercise is to implement a Queue class, you may **not** use JavaScript's built in push/pop/shift/unshift functions. You can use an Object or Array to store your data and keep a head and tail pointer that moves around when functions like enqueue and dequeue are called.

Let's get started!
